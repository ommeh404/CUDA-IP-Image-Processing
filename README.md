Aerial Image Processing - Edge Detection
Overview
This project focuses on processing aerial images from the USC SIPI Image Database using C++ and OpenCV. The main goal is to apply various image processing techniques to enhance the images and demonstrate the ability to handle large image datasets efficiently and perform Edge Detection.

Objectives
Process a set of aerial images using image processing techniques.
Demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming and the use of OpenCV.
Efficiently handle and process a large number of images.
Measure and analyze performance of the processing pipeline.
Provide clear documentation and instructions for reproducibility.
Data Used
Dataset: Aerial images from the USC SIPI Image Database. (100MB+)
Format: High-resolution .tiff images of aerial photographs.
Number of Images: 38 images of 10 MB each.
Image Processing Techniques Applied
Grayscale Conversion

Converted color images to grayscale to simplify processing and reduce computational load.
Histogram Equalization

Enhanced image contrast to improve the visibility of features.
Canny Edge Detection (Optional)

Detected edges in the images to highlight boundaries and structures.
Gaussian Blurring (Optional)

Applied Gaussian blur to reduce noise and detail.
Thresholding (Optional)

Converted grayscale images to binary images based on a threshold value.

Requirements
Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows
C++ Compiler: Supports C++17 standard
GCC: Version 8.0 or higher
Clang: Version 7.0 or higher
Visual Studio: 2017 or higher
CMake: Version 3.10 or higher
OpenCV: Version 4.x installed on your system
Git: For cloning the repository
Internet Connection: To download the dataset
Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/CUDA-IP-Image-Processing.git
cd CUDA-IP-Image-Processing
Replace your_username with your GitHub username.

2. Obtain the Data
The aerial images are not included in the repository due to their size. Use the provided script to download the images.

2.1. Download the Data
Make the script executable:

chmod +x download_data.sh
Run the script:

./download_data.sh
This script will:

Create a data/aerials/ directory if it doesn't exist.
Download the aerial images from the USC SIPI Image Database.
Save the images into the data/aerials/ directory.
Note: Ensure you have wget installed. If not, install it using:

Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt-get install wget
macOS (with Homebrew):

brew install wget
3. Build the Project
3.1. Create a Build Directory
It's good practice to build the project in a separate directory:

mkdir build
cd build
3.2. Run CMake to Configure the Build
cmake ..
3.3. Compile the Project
make
This will compile the code and create an executable named main.

How to Run
From the build/ directory, execute the program:

./main
Default Behavior:

Input Directory: ../data/aerials/
Output Directory: ../results/
Using Command-Line Arguments:

You can specify custom input and output directories:

./main <input_directory> <output_directory>
Example:

./main ../data/aerials ../results
Results and Verification
Processed Images:

The processed images will be saved in the results/ directory with filenames prefixed by processed_.

Verify the Results:

Open the images in an image viewer to verify that the processing has been applied correctly. You should notice:

Enhanced contrast due to histogram equalization.
(Optional) Edges highlighted if edge detection is enabled.
(Optional) Blurring effect if Gaussian blur is applied.
(Optional) Binary images if thresholding is applied.
Performance Metrics
Total Processing Time: Approximately 7.69 seconds for 38 images on a standard machine.

Performance Measurement:

The program measures and outputs the total time taken to process all images, providing an indication of its efficiency.

Optimization:

Efficient handling of large datasets by processing images in a loop.
Potential for further optimization using multithreading or GPU acceleration with CUDA.
Challenges Faced
Handling Large Files:

Issue: GitHub's file size limitations prevented large image files from being included in the repository.
Solution: Excluded large files using .gitignore and provided a script to download them.
Compatibility with C++17:

Issue: The use of std::string::ends_with caused compilation errors since it's a C++20 feature.
Solution: Implemented a custom endsWith function to ensure compatibility with C++17.
File Path Issues:

Issue: Relative paths caused runtime errors when the program couldn't find the input directory.
Solution: Modified the code to accept command-line arguments for input and output directories and provided clear instructions.
Git Merge Conflicts:

Issue: Encountered conflicts when pushing to GitHub due to differences between local and remote branches.
Solution: Merged remote changes into the local branch, resolved conflicts, and successfully pushed the code.
Future Improvements
GPU Acceleration with CUDA:

Integrate CUDA to leverage GPU acceleration for faster processing times.
Multithreading:

Implement multithreading to process multiple images concurrently.
Advanced Image Processing Techniques:

Apply machine learning models for tasks like object detection or segmentation.
User Interface:

Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to interactively select processing options.
Error Handling and Logging:

Enhance error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.
Implement logging mechanisms to record processing details and potential issues.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the ability to process a large set of aerial images using C++ and OpenCV. By applying image processing techniques such as histogram equalization and edge detection, the images are enhanced to improve visibility and highlight important features. The project also showcases efficient handling of large datasets and provides a foundation for further exploration into advanced image processing and optimization techniques.
